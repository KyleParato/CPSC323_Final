Welcome, all code is in the Compiler directory and all relevant pdfs for the report and in the 323_Report folder.
-Compile
To compile and run the project, use the 323FinalBuild.sh script.
-Run
To run the project, you can run the cmp323.out file or use the compiler.sh script.
I recommend using the compiler.sh script as it runs the compiler and then prompts for 
compiling/running the c++ output file.
